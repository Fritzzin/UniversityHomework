# UniversityHomework
Old homework files that I've used or that I've written through my time at Software Engineering university. Some files were removed due to taking too much space or not having anything to do with programming or IT in general.

:warning:These are just backup files from my old university projects/tasks.:warning:

## Structure

The structure of the directories goes as follows:

```Year/Semester/Class/Task```

Some might have a different pathing, but for most part they follow this pattern.
